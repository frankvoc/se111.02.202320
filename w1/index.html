        <p style="font-family: Arial"> My name is <b>Frank Vocatura</b> and I am enrolled in the Software Engineering program at <i>NEIT</i>. I am 22 years old and was born in <u>Westerly, Rhode Island.</u> I graduated from Westerly High School in 2019 and took a few courses at CCRI. Some things I enjoy are playing games on my computer, coding and traveling. I am very excited to learn more about HTML and Java in this course!</p>
